                <br></br>I designed it all myself using React.js. I wanted to have the freedom<br></br>
                to use custom styling, and incorporate some of my personal creativity.<br></br> 
                I have a passion for frontend design, and I thought this would be a great way <br></br>
                to showcase that.<br></br>
